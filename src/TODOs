TODO's New Feature:
- Implement random landscape generator (Ben)
- Implement cave generator (Ben) (look at perlin noise)
- Add splash & menu screens (Nathan)
- Change key-bindings (Nathan)
- Implement lightning & shadows, and light sources from sun, moon?, blocks, (yet to be implemented) objects, ...
- Implement "mini"-cubes
- Add objects (like a flower, a football, ...) (idea: objects are build out of very tiny cubs?)
- Add an ingame object maker system (if using objects made out of cubes this could get realy interesting, think about a woodcarver using his skills & tools to sculp art from a chunk of wood)
- Add NPC's (like sheep, cows, zombies, ...) (don't mind AI too much yet, just basic wandering around is enough, we don't know yet how we'll use them)
- Add support for transparent blocks (important to consider them in mesh-creation)
- Add support for dynamic blocks (like growing tree's, flowers, plants)
- Add physics to the cubes that make up the world (no floating blocks anymore)
- Make blocks able to break when experiencing too much force (think about splitting the cube in mini-cubes for when for example a stone(1 block) falls from realy high and shatters on impact), both collision force and pressure
- Do the same for objects (especialy potent when using objects made out of cubes)
- Implement basic finite fluids (like water that overflows its container) (idea: make fluids evaporate, rain-down, sink through certain block-types (at a certain rate))
- Implement fluid physics (pressure)
- Implement a way to "smooth" the blocks into a more classic 3D RPG-like enviroment

TODO's Optimizations:
- (low priority) Changes in chunks rebuild the entire chunk, might be possible inplace adjustments could be faster
- Maybe some sort of Frustum Culling for chunks could speed things up
- Triangle merging (especialy potent because it happens alot that 2 or more blocks of the same material are adjecent)
- Implement LevelOfDetail
- Buffer chunks that will/could be needed

TODO's Refactoring:
- Everything :(

TODO's Debugging:
- Make players not able to place a block when and object is blocking its location
- Infamous dirt/grass bug
